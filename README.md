# ESP32-lcd-distance
This repository contains all you need to have a distance sensor's reading shown on an LCD display. 

I am using an ESP32 DevKitC and this code works with it.  

I have used dhylands' python_lcd library and the micropython-hcsr04 from rsc1975.

See my blog at www.sabulo.com for all my projects with Arduino, ESP32, 3D modeling with Blender, and 3D printing with a variety of machines.
